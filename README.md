# Myna: Masking-Based Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations

Welcome to the official repository for **Myna: Masking-Based Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations**. This repository contains the codebase and public models used in the paper.

![The Myna Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghost-signal/myna/refs/heads/main/static/framework.png)

## Model Checkpoints

We provide pretrained model checkpoints for different configurations of the Myna model:

- [Myna-Base](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZgR9zqTHz7a0To4X6PWHOuOlM8DBwvL/view?usp=sharing)  
- [Myna-Vertical](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8ZjL29Y_GII1v808x0k0-tv5rR7GWGA/view?usp=sharing)  
- [Myna-Hybrid](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-U4BmDVOf2kllsXY0H3R1GNat9kZaWrp/view?usp=sharing)  

Feel free to download and use these models for your tasks.

## Inference Example

To get started with inference, you can refer to the minimal example provided in the script [example.py](https://github.com/ghost-signal/myna/blob/main/example.py).
